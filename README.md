# RPS Challenge

- I programmed a Rock Paper Scissors game using Sinatra using an MVC model.
- Completed all user stories, including single and multi player modes.
- Test Coverage: 100%
- Use shotgun or rackup to run server
- Access the game from '/' route

### Questions
- Is it possible to store parameters based on user click on images?
- Is it possible to dynamically load a page depending on user input on the same page? (or do you need JS)
